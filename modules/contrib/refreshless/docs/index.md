![Stylized "RefreshLess"](assets/optimized/title.svg)

This is the documentation for [the RefreshLess
module](https://www.drupal.org/project/refreshless).

# User guide

This is the documentation for [installing](user/install.md) and using
RefreshLess on a web site/web app.

# Integrating

This is the documentation for integrating with or extending the RefreshLess
module. Generally speaking, RefreshLess is intended to be installed and just
work without any further configuration required. However, if you want to build
more advanced interactions based on what RefreshLess does, you can find
[guidelines for writing your behaviours](integrating/behaviours.md),
[a reference of all events](integrating/events.md) that we trigger and the
information they provide, and [our minimal API](integrating/api.md).

# Developing

This is the documentation for getting involved with the development of
RefreshLess itself. See [where you can get started helping
out](developing/start.md).

# About

Why does this module exist and what are the arguments for server-rendered web sites/web apps? [Read the motivation page](about/motivation.md).
