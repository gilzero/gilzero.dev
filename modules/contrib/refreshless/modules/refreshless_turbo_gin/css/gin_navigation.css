/**
 * Prevents Gin navigation sidebar transition occurring during a Turbo visit.
 *
 * This mostly fixes the issue of the page wrapper doing a quick and jarring
 * side to side movement on the edge where the sidebar is located when Turbo
 * swaps out the <body> contents. While this works nearly 100% of the time, it
 * still occasionally allows a transition to sneak in so we may have to create
 * a JavaScript behaviour to apply a class to the <html> element and only remove
 * it when the <body> has settled.
